        <h3>Design And Development</h3>
        <p>I started coding recently but to my interests it has been fascinating. I was always curious while playing video games and scrolling websites ,to understand how they are really built and now that i know , i am sure i will be making my own
          websites and video games. </p>

        <h3>Rubic's Cube</h3>
        <p>But my best skill is to solve a bunch of different types of Rubic's Cube. I know that is kind of nerdy but it is actually fun and i know i can beat you to it, stranger on the other side!</p>
